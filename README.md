# Blockchain Freelancing Platform

> **Eliminating middlemen in freelance work through blockchain technology**

## Overview

A decentralized freelancing platform where clients post jobs, freelancers bid with staked tokens, and smart contracts handle payments automatically. No platform fees, no payment disputes, no middlemen.

### Core Problems We Solve
- **Payment delays**: Smart contracts release payments automatically
- **High platform fees**: Direct peer-to-peer transactions (0% platform fee)
- **Biased disputes**: Random arbitrator selection from different regions
- **Low-quality bids**: Freelancers stake tokens to bid (skin in the game)

## Key Features

**Wallet Authentication**
```javascript
// Connect wallet to register
const user = await platform.register(walletAddress);
```

**Stake-to-Bid System**
```solidity
function submitBid(uint256 jobId, uint256 amount) external payable {
    require(msg.value >= 0.01 ether, "Minimum stake required");
    // Store bid with stake
}
```

**Smart Escrow with Yield**
```javascript
// Funds earn interest while in escrow
const escrow = await contract.createEscrow(jobId, amount);
// Automatically splits yield between client and freelancer
```

**Fair Dispute Resolution**
```solidity
// Random arbitrator selection using Chainlink VRF
function selectArbitrators(uint256 disputeId) external {
    requestRandomness(keyHash, fee);
}
```
